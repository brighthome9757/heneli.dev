Heneli Kailahi is a software engineer who can bring the best insights from functional programming to any engineering context. His research interests include typed functional programming, the intersection of DX and algebra, and paths toward democratizing industry.

At his [previous job](https://www.tvisioninsights.com/), Heneli occupied both backend and data engineering roles: 

* Using [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/), he designed algorithms to synthesize media attention metrics from audio content recognition, CV models, ad metadata, and other data sources. Here, he honed his insights on the semantic complexity of large data histories. Drawing from static refinement, data visualization, software interactivity, and modern operational techniques, he continues developing new theories simplifying data programming today.

* Using [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), he developed backend services for driving evolving data pipelines, configuring a fleet of 1k+ volunteer panelist devices, and orchestrating various data ingestion into an internal metadata workflow engine. Through judicious application of advanced functional programming techniques, a small team of backend developers were able scale their impact and evolve code to meet the hectic data needs of a growing startup.
