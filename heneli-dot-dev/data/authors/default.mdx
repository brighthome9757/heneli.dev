### Author

### Author

My name is Heneli. I'm a senior software engineer specializing in high-performance data systems and functional programming. I bridge the gap between backend architecture and data engineering to build systems that are both reliable and maintainable.

* At [Scarf Systems](https://scarf.sh), I led a migration from OLTP-based pre-aggregated analytics to OLAP-based real-time analytics, scaled backend services, and integrated customer-driven controls into Scarf's metadata enrichment pipeline while delivering sub-50ms event processing times. I optimized analytical queries supporting dynamic filtering to achieve sub-second dashboard performance across billions of events, applying advanced database techniques within [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com/).

* I'm particularly passionate about database internals and bringing [functional programming](https://www.haskell.org/) principles to engineering challenges. My work combines rigorous system design with practical performance optimization.
