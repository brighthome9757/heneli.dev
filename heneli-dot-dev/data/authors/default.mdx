Heneli Kailahi is a software engineer who can bring the best insights from functional programming to any engineering context. His research interests include typed functional programming, the intersection of DX and algebra, and paths toward democratizing industry.

At his [previous job](https://www.tvisioninsights.com/), Heneli occupied both backend and data engineering roles:

* Using [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/), he designed algorithms to synthesize media attention metrics from audio content recognition, CV models, ad metadata, and other data sources. Here, he honed his insights on the semantic complexity of large data histories. Drawing from static refinement, data visualization, software interactivity, and modern operational techniques, he continues developing new theories for simplifying data programming.

* Using [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), he and small team of engineers developed backend services to drive evolving data pipelines, manage a 1000+ device fleet for paid panelists, and facilitate various data ingestions through an internal workflow engine. Through judicious application of advanced functional programming techniques, his team was able to greatly scale their impact and evolve a nimble codebase to meet the hectic data needs of a growing startup.
