### Author

Heneli is a software engineer who can bring the best insights from functional programming to any engineering context. At his [previous job](https://www.tvisioninsights.com/), Heneli occupied both backend and data engineering roles:

* Using [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/), he designed algorithms to synthesize media attention metrics from audio content recognition, CV models, ad metadata, and other data sources. Drawing on ideas from static refinement, program visualization, local-first systems, and modern operational techniques, he continues developing strategies to simplify data programming.

* Using [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), he and small team of engineers developed backend services to drive evolving data pipelines, manage a 1000+ device fleet for paid panelists, and facilitate various data ingestions through an internal workflow engine. Through judicious application of advanced functional programming techniques, his team was able to greatly scale their impact and evolve a nimble codebase to meet the hectic data needs of a growing startup.
