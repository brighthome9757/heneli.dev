<u>**Prerequisites**</u>: You should be familiar with using basic typeclasses. If not, check out Serokell's [*Introduction to Haskell Typeclasses*](https://serokell.io/blog/haskell-typeclasses) or the _Typeclasses and Instances_ section from Kowainik's [*Strategic Deriving*](https://kowainik.github.io/posts/deriving#typeclasses-and-instances).
</Note>

Typeclass instances are a powerful tool for specifying which overloaded operations are allowed on which types. But what about specifying which operations are _disallowed_ on which types? With the arrival of `Unsatisfiable` in [GHC 9.8.1](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/blog/2023-07-27-ghc-9.8.1-alpha1-released.html), Haskell has better answers now than ever before.

## Anti-Instances: Past and Present

An anti-instance is the intentional rejection of a possible typeclass instance. Anti-instances can be defined implicitly by omission or explicitly by custom type error.

### Omitted Instances

The easiest and most common method for dissallowing a typeclass operation on a given type is to simply not provide the corresponding typeclass instance.

As an example, let's look at omitted instances on [`Data.Semigroup.First`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.18.0.0/docs/Data-Semigroup.html#t:First):

```hs:Data.Semigroup
newtype First a = First { getFirst :: a }

instance Semigroup (First a) where
    (<>) :: First a -> First a -> First a
    a <> _ = a
```

`First` comes with a `Semigroup` instance as [`(<>)`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.18.0.0/docs/Data-Semigroup.html#v:-60--62-), an append operation obeying the associativity law[^1], can be implemented for combining `First` values.

<caption className="flex justify-center text-base">Fig 1: Combines two values by selecting the first</caption>
```hs:ghci
λ> First 99 <> First 12 <> First 30 <> First 7
First 99
λ> ((First 12 <> First 30) <> First 7) <> First 99
First 12
λ> First 12 <> (First 30 <> (First 7 <> First 99))
First 12
```

On the other hand, there is no `Monoid` instance provided for `First`. No value can be supplied to `First` that, when combined a distinct second value, would result in the second value. Therefore [`mempty`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.18.0.0/docs/Data-Monoid.html#v:mempty), an "empty" value satisfying the identity law[^1], cannot be implemented for `First`.

Typeclass hierarchies let users distinguish how different types behave through the operations they implement and laws they satisfy. Looking at hierarchies in the reverse direction makes them an easy place to discover intentionally omitted instances.[^2]

### Using `TypeError`

The 2016 release of GHC 8.0.1 introduced [`TypeError`](https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/9.0.1/docs/html/users_guide/exts/type_errors.html) for custom compile-time errors. Unlike with omitted instances, `TypeError` enables explicit anti-instances:

```hs
{-# LANGUAGE GHC2021, DataKinds #-}

import GHC.TypeError (TypeError, ErrorMessage (Text))

class ReflexiveEq a where
    reflexiveEq :: a -> a -> Bool

instance TypeError
  (Text "Equality is not reflexive on Double: NaN /= NaN")
  => ReflexiveEq Double where
    reflexiveEq _ _ = False
```

Triggering a compilation error with the above anti-instance can be seen below:

```hs:ghci
λ> reflexiveEq (1 :: Double) (1 :: Double)

<interactive>:30:1: error: [GHC-64725]
    • Equality is not reflexive on Double: NaN /= NaN
    • In the expression: reflexiveEq (1 :: Double) (1 :: Double)
```

Custom type errors enable user-defined error messages and provide concrete pointers for code documentation and reference in discussions. `TypeError` improves developer experience by enhancing library accessibility, IDE tool tips, and user interactions with the compiler.

One downside of `TypeError` is its implementation as a type-level function.[^3] This provides flexibility, but makes it more difficult to understand [when exactly a `TypeError` will be thrown](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0433-unsatisfiable.rst#motivation).

While `TypeError` usage has been minor within the Haskell ecosystem, there are some very cool examples of them appearing in several libraries.[^4]

### Introducing `Unsatisfiable`

The upcoming GHC 9.8.1 release will bring an improved version of `TypeError` called `Unsatisfiable`.

```hs
{-# LANGUAGE GHC2021, DataKinds #-}

import GHC.TypeError (Unsatisfiable, ErrorMessage (Text))

instance Unsatisfiable
  (Text "Halt! Functions cannot be compared for equality.")
  => Eq (a -> b)
```

Triggering a compilation error with the above anti-instance can be seen below:

```hs:ghci
λ> (\x -> x) == (\y -> y)

<interactive>:18:11: error: [GHC-22250]
    • Halt! Functions cannot be compared for equality.
    • In the expression: (\ x -> x) == (\ y -> y)
```

Anti-instances defined with `Unsatisfiable` look nearly identical to those defined with `TypeError`, but have some additional benefits. Unlike `TypeError`, `Unsatisfiable` is a typeclass and thus produces types of kind `Constraint`.

```hs:ghci
λ> :kind TypeError
TypeError :: ErrorMessage -> b
λ> :kind Unsatisfiable
Unsatisfiable :: ErrorMessage -> Constraint
```

This results in more predictable error reporting and fixes buggy behavior seen when `TypeError` is used with `-fdefer-type-errors`. You can find more details on its advantages in the [`Unsatisfiable` GHC Proposal](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0433-unsatisfiable.rst).

{/* Most important/prominent/ to users is in they will better match expectations with regards to compile-time behavior and provided greater convience. // TODO - Flesh out */}

## Tips & Tricks

### Escape Hatch

What if you _really need_ an operation from an outlawed instance? Whether facing an implicit anti-instance by omission or an explicit anti-instance by custom type error, the solution is to use a newtype.

Newtypes overcome anti-instances by creating a wrapper type upon which fresh instances can be created without polluting the underlying type.

For example, we can implement a `Monoid` instance on `UnsafeFirst` without worrying about the `Monoid` anti-instance on `First`:

```hs
{-# OPTIONS_GHC -fno-warn-orphans #-}
{-# LANGUAGE GHC2021, DataKinds #-}

import Data.Semigroup (First)
import GHC.TypeError (Unsatisfiable, ErrorMessage (Text))

instance Unsatisfiable (Text "First lacks an identity element")
   => Monoid (First a)

-- | `First`, but with a `Monoid` instance
newtype UnsafeFirst a = UnsafeFirst
  { getUnsafeFirst :: First a }
  deriving (Show, Semigroup)

instance Monoid (UnsafeFirst a) where
  mempty :: UnsafeFirst a
  mempty = error "certified law breaker"
```

This "works":

```hs:ghci
λ> UnsafeFirst (First 1) <> UnsafeFirst (First 3)
UnsafeFirst {getUnsafeFirst = First {getFirst = 1}}
λ> UnsafeFirst (First 1) <> mempty
UnsafeFirst {getUnsafeFirst = First {getFirst = 1}}
```

...at least until there's a law-breaking `mempty` in the first position.

```hs:ghci
λ> mempty <> UnsafeFirst (First 3)
UnsafeFirst {getUnsafeFirst = First
  {getFirst = *** Exception: certified law breaker
CallStack (from HasCallStack):
  error, called at <interactive>:52:12 in interactive:Ghci7
```

Clearly the above example is a bad idea. Carefully consider whether this workaround is a good idea and truly necessary in your case. There's likely a different representation for your data that can better achieve your goals.

For example, a different `First` datatype exists in `Data.Monoid` that wraps the `Maybe` datatype.

```hs:Data.Monoid
newtype First a = First { getFirst :: Maybe a }

instance Semigroup (First a) where
  (<>) :: First a -> First a -> First a
  First Nothing <> b = b
  a             <> _ = a

instance Monoid (First a) where
  mempty :: First a
  mempty = First Nothing
```

Combining values under `Data.Semigroup.First` means selecting the first value, while combining values under `Data.Monoid.First` means selecting the first "non-empty" value.

```hs:ghci
λ> First Nothing <> First Nothing <> First Nothing
First {getFirst = Nothing}
λ> ((First Nothing <> First (Just 99)) <> First Nothing) <> First (Just 33)
First {getFirst = Just 99}
λ> First Nothing <> (First (Just 99) <> (First Nothing <> First (Just 33)))
First {getFirst = Just 99}
```

### Verified Counterexamples

One of Haskell's strengths is its facilities for making assumptions explicit.[^5] Rather than implicitly omitting impossible instances, Haskellers can communicate intent with anti-instances. Further, claims about why an anti-instance exists can be strenghtened by incorporating machine-checked validations.

Using property-based testing with [doctests](https://serokell.io/blog/doctests-in-haskell), we can provide the verification of typeclass instances and anti-instances directly in our documentation. The presence of counterexamples from generated values makes it clear which anti-instances are legitimately law-breaking. Likewise, the absence of counterexamples from generated values makes it clear which typeclass instances are legitimately law-abiding.

## Footnotes

[^1]:
    * Associativity Law: An operation is associative if parenthesizing its usage from left-to-right and right-to-left evaluates to the same value. Types with operations obeying the associative law can be given a [`Semigroup`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.18.0.0/docs/Data-Semigroup.html#t:Semigroup) instance.
    * Identity Law: An operation has a neutral element, or [identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_element), if there exists an element that can be combined with any other element without changing the other element. Types with an operation obeying the associative law and an identity element for that operation can be given a `Monoid` instance.

    Testing anti-instances against something like `monoidLaws` in [`quickcheck-classes`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/quickcheck-classes) or [`hedgehog-classes`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hedgehog-classes) won't work. This is a good thing, as those checkers require operations from typeclass instances that we _don't_ want to exist.

    One workaround is to provide a false implementation of typeclass operations as a record, and pass it around manually like a typeclass would if it was handling the plumbing. This is the approach taken in the Figure 2. That example's false implementation turned out to be problematic as it relied on any non-generated values. As my earlier point was more the ability to co-locate testing and instances within documentation, I've decided to leave the example as is (for now).

    Two interesting things to explore would be a) making law-checking without a valid instance more ergonomic and b) a fancier anti-instance wrapper that takes a counterexample as input before returning an `Unsatisfiable` constraint.
