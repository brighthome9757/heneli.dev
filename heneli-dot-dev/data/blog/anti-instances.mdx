<u>**Prerequisites**</u>: You should be familiar with using basic typeclasses. If not, check out Serokell's [Introduction to Haskell Typeclasses](https://serokell.io/blog/haskell-typeclasses) or the _Typeclasses and Instances_ section from Kowainik's [Strategic Deriving](https://kowainik.github.io/posts/deriving#typeclasses-and-instances).
</Note>

Typeclass instances are a powerful tool for specifying which overloaded operations are allowed on which types. But what about specifying operations that are _disallowed_ on certain types? With the arrival of `Unsatisfiable` in [GHC 9.8.1](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/blog/2023-07-27-ghc-9.8.1-alpha1-released.html), Haskell has better answers now than ever before.

## Anti-Instances: Past and Present

### Omitted Instances

The easiest and most common method for dissallowing typeclass methods is for is to simply not provide a typeclass instance implementation. For example, take `Data.Semigroup.First` from [`base`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.18.0.0/docs/Data-Semigroup.html#t:First):

<caption className="flex justify-center text-base">Fig 1: Combines values by returning the first</caption>
```hs:ghci
λ> First 99 <> First 12 <> First 30 <> First 7
First 99
λ> ((First 12 <> First 30) <> First 7) <> First 99
First 12
λ> First 12 <> (First 30 <> (First 7 <> First 99))
First 12
```

`First` can't have a (lawful) `Monoid` instance because it can't satisfy the identity law. That is, there is no value which can be supplied to `First` that, when combined with a second value, would result in the second (or anything other than the first value).

One of the easiest places to find intentionally omitted instances is typeclass heirarchies.[^1] [Counterexamples of Type Classes](https://blog.functorial.com/posts/2015-12-06-Counterexamples.html) covers several intentionally omitted instances in Purescript language, which has a lot of overlap with Haskell.

### Using `TypeError`

The release of GHC 8.0.1 in 2016 brought [`TypeError`](https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/8.0.1/docs/html/users_guide/glasgow_exts.html#custom-errors) to [`base`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.18.0.0/docs/GHC-TypeError.html#t:TypeError).

While custom type errors have not been especially common in the Haskell ecosystem, there are some examples of them being used for very cool things.[^2]

https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ghc-medium-term-priorities/5600/21?u=angerman

```hs
{-# LANGUAGE GHC2021, DataKinds #-}

import GHC.TypeError (TypeError, ErrorMessage (Text))

class ReflexiveEq a where
    reflexiveEq :: a -> a -> Bool

instance TypeError
  (Text "Equality is not reflexive on Double: Nan /= NaN")
  => ReflexiveEq Double where
    reflexiveEq _ _ = False
```

Triggering this custom type error can be seen below:

```hs:ghci
λ> reflexiveEq (1 :: Double) (1 :: Double)

<interactive>:30:1: error: [GHC-64725]
    • Equality is not reflexive on Double: Nan /= NaN
    • In the expression: reflexiveEq (1 :: Double) (1 :: Double)
```

The use of type families (aka type-level functions) in `TypeError` requires some type-level sophistication from users.

### Introducing `Unsatisfiable`

Replace type families with type classes (kind constraint). These are

Using custom type errors to define intentional "anti-instances".

```hs
{-# LANGUAGE GHC2021, DataKinds #-}

import GHC.TypeError (Unsatisfiable, ErrorMessage (Text))

instance Unsatisfiable
  (Text "Halt! Functions cannot be compared for equality.")
  => Eq (a -> b)
```

// TODO - No `UndecidableInstances` needed `ghci-9.8.0.20230727`

Triggering this custom type error can be seen below:

```hs:ghci
λ> (\x -> x) == (\y -> y)

<interactive>:18:11: error: [GHC-22250]
    • Halt! Functions cannot be compared for equality.
    • In the expression: (\ x -> x) == (\ y -> y)
```

Unlike `TypeError`, which is a type family, `Unsatisfiable` is a typeclass and has kind `Constraint`.

```hs:ghci
λ> :kind TypeError
TypeError :: ErrorMessage -> b
λ> :kind Unsatisfiable
Unsatisfiable :: ErrorMessage -> Constraint
```

The [`Unsatisfiable` GHC Proposal](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0433-unsatisfiable.rst) goes into more detail on the advantages of `Unsatisfiable` over `TypeError`.

## Tips & Tricks

### Escape Hatch

Okay but what if you _really need_ an outlawed instance? Use the newtype, Luke!

```hs
{-# OPTIONS_GHC -fno-warn-orphans #-}
{-# LANGUAGE GHC2021, DataKinds #-}

import Data.Semigroup (First)
import GHC.TypeError (Unsatisfiable, ErrorMessage (Text))

instance Unsatisfiable (Text "First lacks an identity element")
   => Monoid (First a)

-- | `First`, but with a `Monoid` instance
newtype UnsafeFirst a = UnsafeFirst
  { getUnsafeFirst :: First a }
  deriving (Show, Semigroup)

instance Monoid (UnsafeFirst a) where
  mempty :: UnsafeFirst a
  mempty = error "certified law breaker"
```

This "works"...

```hs:ghci
λ> UnsafeFirst (First 1) <> UnsafeFirst (First 3)
UnsafeFirst {getUnsafeFirst = First {getFirst = 1}}
λ> UnsafeFirst (First 1) <> mempty
UnsafeFirst {getUnsafeFirst = First {getFirst = 1}}
```

...until there's a law-breaking `mempty` in the first position.

```hs:ghci
λ> mempty <> UnsafeFirst (First 3)
UnsafeFirst {getUnsafeFirst = First
  {getFirst = *** Exception: certified law breaker
CallStack (from HasCallStack):
  error, called at <interactive>:52:12 in interactive:Ghci7
```

If you don't like terrible ideas, there is almost certainly a better way to achieve your goals. For example, there a different `First` datatype in `Data.Monoid` which is able to be a `Monoid` by wrapping the underlying value in a `Maybe`. Combining values under `Data.Semigroup.First` means taking the first value, while combining values under `Data.Semigroup.First` means taking the first non-`Nothing` value. Still, it's useful to know that it's possible to work around inherited restrictions when one disagrees with them.

### Statically-Checked Counterexamples

One of the best parts of Haskell is how it makes being explicit ergonomic.[^4] Rather than implicitly omitting instances, Haskellers can communicate intent with anti-instances. We can go beyond just providing an explanitory compilation error message and incorporate machine-checked proof into our documentation.

Using property-based testing with [doctests](https://serokell.io/blog/doctests-in-haskell), we can pair laws and get them directly in our documentation to show typeclass instances that are law-abiding or anti-instances which are intentionally law-breaking.

Statically-checked counter examples!

For good reason, testing against something like [`quickcheck-classes`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/quickcheck-classes) or [`hedgehog`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hedgehog-classes) won't work because there's no typeclass instance for providing operations to assert against (again, this is a good thing). However, we can pass implementation as a record/value instead of through a typeclass to do achieve this. See https://gist.github.com/hkailahi/ccad605dcf79daf426305e58b4d92359 for an example.[^5]

## Tradeoffs

Compile-time?? Pretty simple, we're not deriving anything so prob not?

What if you disagree with an upstream provided anti-instance? Marginally less annoying than but prob still similar issues as with disagreeing with an exisiting instance. Should controversial anti-instances be orphaned off in separate modules? Coherence is a blessing and curse. Unless you know what you're doing, don't do weird stuff.

Using a newtype to recover exstinsibility can be an inconvience (but arguably is one worth paying).

I don't recommend `Unsatisfiable` orphans.

TODO - Check if `UndecidableInstances` is needed with `Unsatisfiable` (like with `TypeError`)

## Future

### Deprecated Instances

// TODO - `DEPRECATED` already exists. Figure out what is different after this proposal.

Currently, the `DEPRECATED` pragma can be used issue deprecation warning on modules, functions, data constructors, and type constructors, but not on typeclass instances. The GHC proposal for [Deprecated Instances](https://github.com/int-index/ghc-proposals/blob/int-index/deprecated-instances/proposals/0000-deprecated-instances.rst) to fix that was accepted last week!

```hs:ghci
instance {-# DEPRECATED "Do not use NFData (a -> b). See deepseq issue #16" #-}
         NFData (a -> b)
  where
    rnf = rwhnf
```

This provides a path for creating a deprecation period to precede breaking changes.
* Coherence conditions notorious breaking changes (frequency? or just more painful?)

Breaking changes can be preceded with a deprecation period when the problematic code triggers a warning.

    Two interesting things to explore would be a) making law-checking without a valid instance more ergonomic and b) a fancier anti-instance wrapper that takes a type-level proof of violation as input and returns an `Unsatisfiable` constraint.
