Sometimes functional programming gets a bad rap. Critics from industry cite a laundry list of issues including lack of commercial validation, high barrier of entry, sparse library catalog, poor documentation, unfamiliar academic culture, and a dismal entry-level job market. Advocates counter [with](https://blog.janestreet.com/why-ocaml/) [a](https://discord.com/blog/how-discord-scaled-elixir-to-5-000-000-concurrent-users) [number](https://blog.replit.com/nix) [of](https://hasura.io/blog/from-zero-to-hipster-haskell-in-production-97ea99d90c3b/) [success](https://www.pagerduty.com/blog/tag/elixir/) [stories](https://mercury.com/) and appeals pointing [to](https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2022/10/05/my-future-with-elixir-set-theoretic-types/) [ongoing](https://blog.janestreet.com/oxidizing-ocaml-locality/) [improvements](https://haskell.foundation/projects/). ‚Äú[Things](https://www.amazon.com/Production-Haskell-Succeeding-Industry/dp/B0BTNVFR2N) _[really](https://zero-to-nix.com/) [are](https://pijul.org/posts/2023-05-23-nest-a-new-hope/)_ [getting](https://zaid-ajaj.github.io/the-elmish-book/#/) [better](https://leanpub.com/fp-made-easier)!‚Äù Deserved or otherwise, skepticism is hard to overcome.

It‚Äôs certainly never been the case that a functional language was the de facto industry standard like all of Java, Python, and JavaScript have been. By choice[^1] or by fate, the benefits born of iterating a language independent of widespread reliance have been traded against predictable costs on functional ecosystems. When there‚Äôs 10,000 new programmers learning an imperative language to every individual learning a functional one, can a functional approach really compete?[^2]

My answer is yes. While the above critiques have merit, I don‚Äôt believe that any of them are inherent. In fact, I‚Äôll argue that the functional paradigm already has best-in-class discoverability and experimentation thanks to **fearless tinkering**.[^3]

## Fearless in Theory

---

### Fear and Complexity

There‚Äôs an endless list of things that invoke fear in programmers:
<div className="overflow-x-auto">
  |  |  |  |   |
  | - | :- | -: | :-: |
  | consistency | rolling upgrades | concurrency | bit rot |
  | year-out deadlines | service alerts | tech debt | stale builds |
  | nondeterminism | clocks | ambiguous requirements | hardware faults |
  | software rewrites | network partitions | scope creep | security |
</div>
...and on and on. Each of these can be terrifying on their own. To make matters worse, software rarely contains just a single source of horror. Very simple programs written by very thoughtful programmers can host a multitude.

Without the right tools, conquering these fears can feel impossible. If your tools can‚Äôt be trusted, your contributions can't be either. Some adopt a defensive programming style, but institutionalizing apprehension isn't an end in itself. What use is an infinite roll of duct tape when a ship takes water? If tape can‚Äôt solve the first leak, should one patch the next, pick their battles, or accept fate and lose hope in the voyage? Does a decision even matter when the ship is already sinking? Maybe swimming to shore and joining a new boat would suffice‚Ä¶ at least until that crew wants to tape their leaks. By then, that too will be someone else‚Äôs problem. The cognitive burden of faulty software is real and difficult to remedy. Programming is a social exercise, and teams will burn out accommodating learned helplessness.

Most fears boil down to uncertainty about **complexity**. As Fred Brooks explained in [No Silver Bullet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet), there exists **essential complexity** that cannot be avoided and **accidental complexity** that can.[^4] [Out of the Tar Pit](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/2eb8d21/design/out-of-the-tar-pit.pdf) followed up by diagnosing **state**, **control flow**, and **code volume** as the most frequent culprits underlying accidental complexity. The nature of complexity is festering and exponential, so tackling root causes is always better than addressing symptoms. Put another way, preventing leaks by addressing the inherent structural deficiencies of a ship‚Äôs build is favorable to being skilled at plugging holes.

**Fearless tinkering** is the ability to engage a domain and confidently reason about it while unencumbered by accidental complexity. Whether the domain is concurrency, software upgrades, or something else, a fearless tinkerer can rely on the structural guarantees of their context to safely explore their domain and target the essential complexity of the task at hand. A fearless tinkerer sails a ship where entire classes of leakage are rendered an impossibility. What kinds of leaks are prevented? How are they decided? As discussed in the following sections, these guarantees are determined by the algebra of one‚Äôs program.

### On Functional Programming

The functional style encourages transformation-based workflows over state-based workflows. To motivate this approach, functional languages commonly offer a collection[^5] of characteristics:[^6]
<div className="overflow-x-auto">
  |  |  |  |   |
  | - | :- | -: | :-: |
  | Referential Transparency | Pure functions | Declarative | Immutability |
  | First-Class Functions | Higher-Order Functions | Expression-Oriented | Pattern Matching |
  | Tail Call Elimination | Managed Effects | Algebraic Datatypes | Compositionality |
  | Recursive Datatypes | Equational Reasoning | | |
</div>

Functional programming doesn‚Äôt solve complexity, but helps one meet it by surfacing its roots. To do this, functional languages deliver several of the more successful and battle-tested approaches to the state, control flow, and volume.

Functional languages _<u>make stateful complexity explicit</u>_. By pairing immutable defaults with performant and easy-to-use APIs, functional languages minimize the need for mutable state. Introducing any mutable state thus becomes an intentional and visible action. Given the elimination of destructive updates, compilers are empowered to reward programmers with greater [expressiveness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fold_%28higher-order_function%29) and [safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_transactional_memory) at less cost. Some functional languages make explicit their ‚Äúeffects‚Äù with types, creating a distinction that allows separate reasoning of ‚Äúeffect-free‚Äù and ‚Äúeffectful‚Äù code.

With a greater reliance on _<u>declarative constructs</u>_ (expressions) over _<u>imperative ones</u>_ (statements), functional languages eliminate a number of control flow complexities. Jump-based statements that break compositionality are replaced with expressions that can be substituted for their value. Bigger programs can be faithfully decomposed into smaller ones. This allows local reasoning on individual parts to hold up when global reasoning is needed about the whole. Thanks to the sole determination of a function‚Äôs outputs on its inputs, purely functional programming creates an experience where ‚Äúwhat you see is what you get‚Äù.

_<u>Compositionality</u>_ also addresses program volume in functional languages. Programs and their domains can be _<u>mechanically decomposed</u>_ into their essential concepts. For instance, verbose wrangling code can be collapsed into neat reusable patterns using higher-order functions and composition. Typed functional languages use various polymorphisms to replace infinitely-many functions over one domain with an economy of functions over infinite domains. Typed functional languages also reduce cognitive volume by offloading the rote calculations of dynamism onto programmer‚Äôs better-suited counterparts in computers. As elaborated in the following section, relegating implementation details to the relevant semantic layer makes declarative APIs naturally terse. Judicious use of abstraction capabilities assists in uncovering rock-solid, lean foundations for APIs and wider ecosystems.

Armed with the properties of functional languages, programmers can reclaim their cognitive sovereignty and fearlessly explore software in action.

### Ideas over Implementation Details

> - a sage functional programmer, probably

If language is a tool for thought, then one should value dialects enabling the natural communication of them. Blunted alternatives that intersperse anything meaningful with robotic recitations of language internals or error-prone adaptations to outside alterations are frustrating to tolerate. A language that yields such fragile mental models debilitates a programmer‚Äôs ability to handle real-world scenarios like context-switching, requirements evolution, and the eventuality of a system‚Äôs growth beyond what can be kept in one‚Äôs head. The essential complexity programmers face is already challenging enough.

When the business calls for an algorithm to determine how many users visited their website last week, no one‚Äôs first thought should have to be about for-loops, heap allocations, hash indexes, logic gates, or cosmic rays. No, an API that‚Äôs better suited to immediate communication might yield something like:

```jsx
all_users -> filter_by(visited_since(-7 days)) -> count()
```

Declarative programming simplifies the act of learning because it 1) meets one at their layer of abstraction and 2) let‚Äôs one focus solely on what‚Äôs in front of them. A well-designed declarative API lays out all the vocabulary and structure one should need, such that formulating solutions through sentences is as natural as placing blocks in a game of Tetris. Learners can focus on describing the place they actually care about instead of the windy road taken to get there. By only necessitating specification of a goal state, programmers are unburdened by the interconnected history of their model's state transitions.

### Constraints Liberate

> Freedom at one level leads to restriction at another. A constraint at one level leads to freedom and power at another level.
>
> - R√∫nar Bjarnason @ Scala World 2015, [Constraints liberate, Liberties constrain](https://youtu.be/GqmsQeSzMdw)

Observing the underlying properties of a program is the key to unlocking its simplification. Pure functions are simple because of the numerous constraints imposed on them. The restriction of mapping input sets onto output sets eases the discovery of additional relationships in one‚Äôs program. Employing popular [functional](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/) [techniques](https://kowainik.github.io/posts/haskell-mini-patterns#phantom-type-parameters) to prune superfluous code paths can make further invariants lurking in our programs even more apparent. By building an arsenal of common operations with associated constraints, one can unlock a useful toolkit of powers to call upon in various programming situations.

One could rightly object that having to learn new mathematical abstractions is trading one kind of complexity for another. In practice, there are but a small handful of core abstractions that programmers will typically run into and are thus worth their collective weight.[^7] Learning frequently occuring abstractions is useful for formalizing one's understanding of the domains they characterize. The major benefit of learning said abstractions is that once you‚Äôve understood them, you‚Äôve understood them for all of their applications.

Programmers make mistakes. As such, our tools should aspire not to punish us for unfamiliarity or occasional incorrectness. Too often users stumble into a tool's legitimate accidental complexity, only to be chided for ‚Äúholding it wrong‚Äù as if they should feel guilty for letting the tool paint them into a corner. Of course, tools that overreact to surface considerations can be just as problematic. No one wants an overzealous tool that ‚Äúhelpfully‚Äù enacts what hasn‚Äôt been asked for. Instead, tools should focus on preventing unrecoverable choices from being made too casually or too late. When a situation calls for an action with serious implications, our tools should help us feel the weight of our request. Uniformly weighting every possibility will mislead users into thinking that either every action is reasonable or every action is fallible. Tools shouldn‚Äôt be afraid to immediately report suspected incorrectness. Discovering mistakes during the construction of a new home is much less painful than making the same discoveries after a family has moved into it.

Approaches that meet each critique with an independent solution are prone to local maxima. Breakthroughs require recognition of the systemic complexities underpinning individual occurrences. Ideally, tools should proactively seek out their fundamental weaknesses, rather than waiting to reactively patch ailments.[^8] Hence, selecting tools by their **structural guarantees** is about using one's **values** to elect the ways in which their software _can‚Äôt_ go wrong. A fearless tinkerer knows they can be wrong, strong!

In this section, I‚Äôll introduce two functional technologies and illustrate how their structural properties enable **fearless tinkering**. These alone won‚Äôt do functional ecosystems justice.[^9] Even amongst the tools mentioned, there are plenty of assurances I won't cover. Conversely, I won't spend much time on their structural deficiencies, vestigial quirks, and footguns[^10]. Much more important than any specific technology are the ideas that underlie them. Calling out the need for fearless approaches to the pain points of daily work will help future technologies incorporate the relevant structural guarantees.


### Nix & NixOS

The entropy of modern software is staggering. Programs inside programs directing separate programs exist, with each layer containing their own digital metropolis. Whether it's the shear connectors in the bridges, building codes of the plumbing networks, or newest floor plan atop a towering skyscraper, every software artifact reflects a choice made by someone somewhere. The feats of modern software could not be made if every virtual wheel needed reinventing. A global and communal project of shared decisions is harnessed to base, tweak, and publish new constructions.

Despite how foundational accessing external developments is, interfacing with outside software remains a tremendous challenge. Every piece of software has its own installation manual and distribution strategy. Attaining pre-built infrastructure or the materials to create one‚Äôs own means traversing complicated and intersecting digital supply chains. Brittle runbooks, non-reproducible scripts, and imperative packaging tools that freely step on each other‚Äôs work lead to uniquely broken and divergent systems. Fundamental issues like build-time variability, unspecified dependencies, and implicit mutation of shared libraries can turn one-off upgrades into intractable archeological treasure hunts. When stuck in dependency hell, a teammate voicing that some software ‚Äúworks on their machine‚Äù offers more dread than helpfulness.

Nix attempts to solve these problems by introducing a purely functional DevOps ecosystem. By representing all software components in an immutable graph, Nix is able to offer rich queries about one‚Äôs system and defang what were previously panic-inducing deployments. With a declarative language for reproducible system configurations, installing software simply becomes the act of writing a Nix expression that describes a target system with that package installed. This same process is true for applying parameter configurations, upgrades, uninstallations, patches, or any deployment action. Instead of divining sequential migration paths, developers and operators can focus solely on what they want their end system to look like. The evolution of traditional infrastructure is contrasted with Nix below.

#### Road to Reproducibility

For many developers, infrastructure is an uncomfortable area. Whether it‚Äôs the state of a cluster on `us-east-2` or a configuration outside one‚Äôs project repository, reasoning about [action at a distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_at_a_distance_%28computer_programming%29) can be treacherous. Further, the stakes are often high when managing software deployments. A tangled web of mutual, implicit dependencies means that modifying one‚Äôs system could lead to invalid and unrecoverable states. Tolerating a ‚Äúworking‚Äù yet unsatisfactory environment is frequently preferable to the risks of transitioning to something better. As experimentation with alternatives is difficult, iterating is normally restricted to when one‚Äôs hand is forced or the alternative has already been intimately understood. Even the modern practice of automated upgrades for existing dependencies is [fraught](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.11921v1). Tools for managing remote infrastructure tend to remain unfamiliar as the consequences of trying them out might yield an expensive `$CLOUD_PROVIDER` bill.

A horrible culmination of these frictions is found in operational firefighting. Operators are tasked with debugging a live system whose interface, tools, and symptoms are typically only practiced against when problems occur. Even in organizations with significant platform investments, the exploratory surface of test deployments rarely reflects the time and space pollution built up across all contributing local developer and remote production environments.

Application programming, in contrast, can give developers a sense of power and ease. Assuming a stable working environment, the behavior and outputs of a local program are far more observable. Equipped with a test harness, REPL, and breakpointing facilities, an interactive view of one‚Äôs program, including local bindings and available operations, can be explored. An application programmer can wield static analyzers, linters, IDE feedback, and all their most familiar tools to iteratively coax their programs into the desired shape. The ultimate execution of their developments can be safely gated behind various stages of evaluation like continuous integration, peer review, staging deployments, and quality assurance.

The extent to which work is disposable is the extent to which work is safe to do. While it might mean tremendous pain in the short term, application programmers can usually throw their hands up and start over from scratch when a local problem arises. If a developer ties their local project repository into a knot, they can blow it away and pull down a fresh copy. During development, application programmers regularly break their domain in ways that would be intolerable anywhere else. Though program behaviors are inseparable from their execution environments, application programmers can approximate control over time and space by fixing their efforts against their own environment.

Can the boons of application programming extend to infrastructure? _Containers_ and _Infrastructure as Code_ (IaC) are frequently touted as solutions, yet their standard implementations fall short. Containers and microVMs do offer [various levels of isolation](https://fly.io/blog/sandboxing-and-workload-isolation/), however, these "encapsulated" environments lack innate compositionality and reproducibility. Docker, for instance, is ["repeatable, but not reproducible"](https://youtu.be/0uixRE8xlbY). Delineating the steps for constructing an image and executing those steps won't guarantee a uniform result. At most, a `Dockerfile` in version control can be nominally linked to an image within a container registry. Although containers can mitigate configuration drift when the same image is employed, they don't ensure consistency when creating a new image or even rebuilding an existing one. The mutable nature of prevalent base images propels users onto unstable grounds and introduces numerous compliance issues. Even more troubling is the fact that standard auditing methods, such as container vulnerability scanners, are [easily thwarted](https://youtu.be/9weGi0csBZM). Containers merely shift around the complexities of imperativity, rather than discharging them. Instead of "works on my machine", containers settle for "works with my image".

Similarly, IaC solutions that advertise themselves as "immutable infrastructure", yet don't guarantee reproducibility, leave a lot to be desired. These tools introduce an inconsistent experience, where environments are delivered declaratively but developed imperatively. Masking a leaky abstraction with a 'declarative' interface obscures pathologies and undermines the original appeal: simplicity.

Meanwhile, Nix has developed to fill these gaps. Nix can fit neatly within existing infrastructure, letting engineers recover [compositionality](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/language/index.html) and [reproducibility](https://r13y.com/) while using [IaC](https://nix.dev/tutorials/nixos/build-and-deploy/deploying-nixos-using-terraform), [containers](https://floxdev.com/blog/flox-and-containers), and other solutions. Nix can also subsume various existing tools with things like NixOS, Home-Manager, Cachix, Hydra, `deploy-rs`, and others. This versatility allows Nix to be introduced piecemeal into projects and organizations.

#### Nix: A Minimal Primer

In the Nix language, everything is an expression. This includes Nix's central data structure, the [derivation](https://zero-to-nix.com/concepts/derivations). **Derivations** can be thought of as recipes for building software components. These recipes include stable references to the nested build plans of their direct dependencies.  A key part of keeping Nix "purely functional" is the separation of evaluation and execution. This distinction is shown by the two steps that make up a Nix build:

1. _**Instantiation**_ - evaluation of Nix expression for assembling a derivation
2. _**Realisation**_ - execution of derivation's instructions + addition of outputted component to the Nix Store

The **Nix Store** is an append-only graph database that stores components in the host's file system (typically under `/nix/store`). Every package, service, and configuration is stored in an immutable way, meaning it cannot be modified after being created. Instead, changes result in new component versions, leaving the previous ones intact.

The location of a component in the Nix Store is determined by the [hash](https://samwho.dev/hashing/) of its derivation. As a derivation contains references to its exact inputs, Nix is able to ensure that a given component is built in the same way every time. This property is referred to as being _input-addressable_, and is how Nix works by default. For example, a `foo` component whose derivation hashes to `9fjirpbq` will be stored at `/nix/store/9fjirpbq-foo`. Any change to a transitive dependency in the Nix expression defining `foo` will result in a different derivation, and thus a new component being written to the Nix Store (ex. `/nix/store/3wby0ym3-foo`).

The Nix literature defines ["correct deployments"](https://books.google.ca/books?id=gP2kAAAACAAJ) as software deployments that "given identical inputs, should behave the same on an end-user machine as on the developer machine". This is a useful albeit weaker notion of reproducibility than [bit-for-bit reproducibility](https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/definition/). While Nix can ensure builds are executed with the same steps and inputs, it can't ensure a deterministic output if the underlying package requires being built with non-deterministic tooling. Rather than storing components by the hash of their build plan, support is progressing for storing components by the hash of their build outputs. This property is referred to as being _content-addressable_, and would reduce recompilation via [_early cutoff_](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2018/03/build-systems.pdf). For obvious reasons, bit-for-bit reproducibility is useful for content-addressable builds.

Nix offers a [rich set of structural properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05688) and shares a lot in common with other merkle structures like `git`. Nix's properties are useful on their own, but offer greater benefit together than the sum of their parts.

Nix has <u>_**transactional semantics**_</u>. Whether installing a new package or upgrading one's system, changes through Nix are <u>_**atomic**_</u>. This means all changes happen at once or not at all. Even if a deployment operation is interrupted, users are never left in a partially updated state. If a completed upgrade causes issues, one can immediately roll back to the previous configuration. As a result, iterating on one's environment can be done without commitment. Users can trial packages using ephemeral shells that don't pollute their environments. Build-time dependencies and binaries for one-off commands can be pruned  beyond their usage. The combination of rollbacks and version control let's one recreate their environment from any point in the past. If one no longer needs a component, they can confidently remove it without fear of changing their mind. Package hoarding is made unnecessary and configurations can be made minimal.

As each package is stored in a <u>_**unique**_</u> path, different versions or variants of a package can coexist without conflict. Users can create and modify multiple developer environments for multiple projects without breaking one another. Users can decide the granularity of their environments like being project, user profile, or system level. One could define a completely isolated developer environment for a project that contained all tooling used like local commands, fully-configured editors, local databases, and more. Alternatively, one could factor out general system configuration into a top-level repository, and allow projects to inherit configurations while remaining explicit.

Nix uses top-level views called [profiles](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/unstable/package-management/profiles.html) to present <u>_**immutable**_</u> environments to users. These views provide a native user experience through symlinks to store paths. For example, a user with a python package in their profile can simply type `python` into their shell instead of a fully qualified path like `/nix/store/7fkcip5k-python3-3.11.3/bin/python`. While these top-level views exhibit a form of mutability, modifications can be reliably reverted. Changing a user's environment will result in a new Nix Store component that is then pointed to by the user's current view. Environments that share the same lineage are called 'generations', and can be 'rolled back' using Nix's CLI to recover a previous profile.

Every artifact in a Nix environment has a traceable origin, a property otherwise known as [_**provenance**_](https://zero-to-nix.com/concepts/provenance). Fetching software over the internet is made safe by requiring that the received contents have a matching hash to that of the expected contents. As detailed below, this same approach powers binary caches while retaining the same compliance benefits of building from source.

#### Fearless Sharing

> When you share code with the world, how are they supposed to build it? Are they sure that they are running the same code that you, the author and builder, intended for them to run?
>
> As engineers, we would love for all these to be true: I show up in a README, it's one command to build the project, run it, and it's built in the exact same way that the developer intended. There's nothing hidden about the build process and I can see that it's repeatable. This is transparency and this is what open source is all about.

<u>_**Reproducibility**_</u> enables reliable distribution of Nix-based infrastructure. Nix enables [<u>_**cloud builds**_</u>](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2018/03/build-systems.pdf), meaning that native builds are amortized across machines. Whether from [Nixpkgs](https://search.nixos.org/packages), a CI server, or a developer machine, packages can be built once and shared anywhere. Nix can recover sharing benefits within infrastructure that isn't Nix-based like [optimally-layered docker images](https://grahamc.com/blog/nix-and-layered-docker-images/) and [system-pinned Bazel builds](https://nix-bazel.build/). Additionally, Nix has [world-class support for cross compilation](https://nix.dev/tutorials/cross-compilation#cross-compilation).

Nix's [<u>_**persistent**_</u>](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/purely-functional-data-structures/0409255DA1B48FA731859AC72E34D494) model allows components to safely and efficiently share dependencies. When multiple local projects require an identically-built executable, Nix will know to never unnecessarily rebuild or redownload it across projects. As the shared executable is protected within an <u>_**immutable**_</u> component store, any changes to a project containing the mutual dependency won't affect the others. Packages can be shared, modified, and upgraded, all without risk of conflict or interference.

Nix ensures [<u>_**hermetic**_</u>](https://zero-to-nix.com/concepts/hermeticity) builds with <u>_**input-addressable**_</u> storage. With Nix, code sharing extends beyond the mere transfer of source files. Environments are authenticated by their derivations and encompass the entire context within which the code is intended to run. This allows Nix to blend the best aspects of both source and binary deployment models, while dodging their respective drawbacks. Building from source provides greater trustworthiness, availability, and configurability, while incurring greater retrieval, compute, and storage costs. Binary caches are cheaper by comparison, but require users that only need what's available. Support for <u>_**content-addressable**_</u> storage in the future will make components self-authenticating and enable greater de-duplication.

  <summary>Package Management</summary>

  The preferred method for installing packages with Nix is [declaratively with a configuration file](https://github.com/hkailahi/dotnix/blob/c59b2e2654f8a84cab1ac59ab72e991ffe84ca70/home.nix#L20). This can be done at the project-level or globally within a system configuration file.

  For example, let's say I needed to install [`firefox`](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=23.05&show=firefox&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=firefox) and upgrade my global [`python`](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=23.05&show=python311&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=python311) installation. Regardless of whether my system configuration was specified with [NixOS](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/#sec-declarative-package-mgmt), [Home-Manager](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/index.html#sec-usage-configuration), or [Nix-Darwin](https://daiderd.com/nix-darwin/), the corresponding configuration change would look something like:

  ```diff
      environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
  -      python310
  +      python311
  +      firefox
      ];
  ```

  You can check out the [system configuration for my 2019 MacBook Pro](https://github.com/hkailahi/dotnix/tree/main) on Github along with [countless others](https://github.com/search?q=dotfiles+language%3ANix&type=repositories&l=Nix).

  <summary>Auditing Packages</summary>

  Let's say I wanted to know the transitive dependencies of my local `python` installation.

  A quick way to verify that a package was actually installed via Nix is to trace its location back to the [Nix Store](https://zero-to-nix.com/concepts/nix-store):
  ```bash
  $ readlink $(which python)
  /nix/store/7fkcip5klr0gksrjgdb3xf0wiz89mdak-python3-3.11.3/bin/python
  ```

  From there, one possible route for gathering dependencies could be to inspect the package's build plan (called a [derivation](https://zero-to-nix.com/concepts/derivations)) to find direct dependencies and the build plans of those dependencies:
  ```bash
  $ nix derivation show $(which python) | jq '.[].inputDrvs | keys'
  [
    "/nix/store/1sh46d9v2n87kabvhnsqqpsrn0l8j9qb-readline-8.2p1.drv",

    "/nix/store/dkx3cs1vqvsafsca08vx681d5jhhsr8v-bzip2-1.0.8.drv",
    "/nix/store/j0xw7lx8bxi6098psd1x9qgqq8k3186d-zlib-1.2.13.drv",
    "/nix/store/kw4n89mqr55jzqpw66sncyvpgs3lscyx-libxcrypt-4.4.33.drv",
    "/nix/store/mbqjy5ff44qsw8bzi7b4q07hnhp5nmy5-mailcap-2.1.53.drv",
    "/nix/store/n92l3i5n4a2z3gy7qhvq6545vvrih0cz-stdenv-darwin.drv",

    "/nix/store/zvh05gmr58z8fkjlnchj5vyd81nbvz23-tzdata-2023c.drv"
  ]
  ```

  One could imagine recursively inspecting ancestral build plans to collect transitive dependencies. Fortunately, there are already ways to do this with the Nix CLI:
  ```bash
  $ nix path-info -r $(which python) | head
  /nix/store/c3d1f6gg0lzfck5cx8yn86s9m5xdbxhg-nghttp2-1.51.0-lib
  /nix/store/c834w8pg8ypl9lcaxqgj2bpsxbv518rn-Libsystem-1238.60.2

  /nix/store/792ghrrsff5p51m13a7sf8bpwxc6isdx-libunistring-1.1
  ```

  The Nix CLI let's us directly query the full dependency graph (called a [transitive closure](https://shopify.engineering/what-is-nix)) and visualize it as either a directory tree or a `graphviz` image:
  ```bash
  $ nix-store --query $(which python) --tree | head

  $ nix-store --query $(which python) --graph | nix-shell --packages graphviz --command 'dot -Tpng > python_deps.png'
  ```
  ![Python Dependency Graph](/static/images/blog/python_deps.png)

  Alternatively, we could interactively inspect these dependencies with the `nix-tree` derivation browser.
  ```bash
  $ nix-tree $(which python)
  ```
  ![Python Dependency Graph](/static/images/blog/nix_tree_python.png)

  Let's say I wanted to distribute this dependency information to others in a commonly understood format. Like ingredient labels on food packaging, [SBOMs](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2022/10/25/the-ultimate-guide-to-sboms/) are an increasingly standard method of providing supply chain transparency for software. SBOMs are a natural fit for Nix as all required provenance is already present in derivations. Furthermore, Nix provides a [great foundation](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dT0DGVbD-5M&t=660s) for wider supply chain security frameworks like [SLSA](https://slsa.dev/).

  Below, I'll use [`sbomnix`](https://github.com/tiiuae/sbomnix) and a temporary `visidata` installation to tabularly inspect the ingredients of my `python` package:
  ```bash
  $ sbomnix $(which python)
  WARNING  Command line argument '--meta' missing: SBOM will not include license information (see '--help' for more details)
  INFO     Loading runtime dependencies referenced by '/nix/store/7fkcip5klr0gksrjgdb3xf0wiz89mdak-python3-3.11.3/bin/python3.11'
  INFO     Wrote: sbom.cdx.json
  INFO     Wrote: sbom.spdx.json
  INFO     Wrote: sbom.csv

  $ nix-shell --packages visidata --command 'vd sbom.csv'
  ```
  ![Python SBOM Visualized](/static/images/blog/sbom_visidata.png)

  As the entire build specification for my `python` installation exists in the Nix Store, tools like [vulnix](https://github.com/nix-community/vulnix) can be used to audit it against the NIST National Vulnerability Database. Moreover, `vulnix --profile` can be used to validate all packages in my user environment while `vulnix --system` validates all packages in the Nix Store.
  ```bash
  $ vulnix $(which python) | head
  9 derivations with active advisories

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ```

  Additionally, [`vulnxscan`](https://github.com/tiiuae/sbomnix/tree/main/scripts/vulnxscan#readme) supports SBOM-based vulnerability scans against [OSV](https://osv.dev/) and [Grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype).

  <summary>Working with Containers</summary>

  OCI images can be created and manipulated with the `dockerTools` module provided by `nixpkgs`. Here is [an example](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable/#sec-pkgs-dockerTools) of a simple nix expression for building an image containing the [`hello`](https://www.gnu.org/software/hello/manual/hello.html) binary:

  ```nix
  pkgs.dockerTools.buildImage {
    name = "hello";
    tag = "latest";
    copyToRoot = pkgs.buildEnv {
      name = "image-root";
      paths = [ pkgs.hello ];
      pathsToLink = [ "/bin" ];
    };

    config.Cmd = [ "/bin/hello" ];
  }
  ```

  Further documentation and examples can be found in the [Nixpkgs Manual](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable/#sec-pkgs-dockerTools). For better optimized containers, see [Optimising Docker Layers for Better Caching with Nix](https://grahamc.com/blog/nix-and-layered-docker-images/) and [`nix2container`](https://github.com/nlewo/nix2container).

## To Be Continued...

That's all for now! The second half of this article will continue with more examples of functional programming in practice. Additionally, the follow-up will discuss how exploiting one's underlying algebra allows any technology to create fearless experiences. Lastly, the article will introduce several promising functional technologies on the horizon and speculate about their fearless futures.

    Per Stack Overflow, Scala (2.59%), Haskell (2.22%), Elixir (2.15%), Clojure (1.51%), F# (1.03%), Erlang (0.9%), and OCaml (0.59%) make up a combined 10.4% of 71,547 responses for [Most Popular Technologies](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#technology-most-popular-technologies) survey, none of which meet the 5000 connection minimum in the 69,362 respondent [Work With vs Want to Work With](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#worked-with-vs-want-to-work-with-language-worked-want) survey.

    Per TIOBE popularity index, only #25 F# (0.53%), #31 Haskell (0.34%), and #38 Scala (0.23%) make the top 50, with all of Elixir, Erlang, Common Lisp, Schema, Clojure, F#, Erlang, and OCaml landing between #51 to #100.

    In the draft versions of this blogpost, I made the stronger claim that functional programming already had best-in-class *learnability*. I suspect that many of my peers would find this absurd. I'll acknowledge that countless have bounced off of functional languages and that huge efforts by functional advocates have been motivated directly because of these approachability issues.

    When I say the functional paradigm has best-in-class *learnability*, my focus is on the inherent qualities of functional languages. One could substitute my use of *learnability* for *understandability*, and that would be a fair starting point. However, that wouldn‚Äôt capture my view that learnability is directly correlated to how far one can explore without consequence. The functional style achieves this freedom by explicating assumptions and enabling both the composition and decomposition of concepts. This burdenless discoverability is why I believe the functional paradigm is more learnable (and continually so) for beginner, intermediate, and advanced practitioners. Functional shops should be doing a [better job](https://eevie.ro/posts/2019-12-30-junior-developers.html) of wielding this market advantage, and yet, bafflingly, many have found ways to turn this strength into a weakness.

    Of course, learning a language in practice has as much to do with the language itself as with its peripherals. Pedagogy, tooling, industrial opportunities, marketing, and community are all essential for initial exposure to ideas and a holistic learning experience. While the peripherals around a paradigm or language can change, the fundamentals are more sticky. The software industry has shown a large appetite for new language variations, but a minimal appetite for new language foundations. While functional languages haven't been popular, they've certainly been influential. A slow yet constant trickle of functional language features into mainstream paradigms has happened as the need to overcome accidental complexity remains.

    This all isn‚Äôt to say that functional programming is the ultimate destination. Comparisons to mainstream paradigms is a limited experiment as none of the existing incarnations are particularly ‚Äúlearnable‚Äù. While the functional paradigm can offer greater safeguards than imperative alternatives, neither has yielded a satisfactory and industrial-grade experience embodying other qualities of a [learnable experience](https://web.archive.org/web/20201105061430/http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/) (ex. interactivity, visualization, uniformity, immediacy, etc). It‚Äôs possible that achieving this will require new paradigms built on top of functional foundations. More on that in the future‚Ä¶
[^4]:
    The definition of accidental complexity in 'Out of the Tar Pit' is more specific, but, for the sake of this article, can be treated more broadly as meaning self-inflicted or avoidable complexity.
[^5]: Overlapping, non-compulsory, non-exhaustive
[^6]:
    You may have noticed that I cowardly deferred to others the task of formally defining ‚Äúfunctional programming‚Äù. The fact of matter is that FP is a vibe.

    More seriously, I use ‚Äúfunctional programming‚Äù as shorthand for a style that avoids mutation and implicit ‚Äúeffects‚Äù. I also define ‚Äúfunctional languages‚Äù as those enabling the representation of programs with expressions that can be substituted for their evaluated value (as is the case for even [‚Äúimpure‚Äù eDSLs like `State` or `IO`](https://twitter.com/lexi_lambda/status/1242878496076189702?s=20)).

    Both the usefulness and accuracy of the term ‚Äúfunctional‚Äù has been debated. Even the meaning and relation of commonly associated descriptors like ‚Äúdeclarative‚Äù is contested. There doesn‚Äôt seem to be a minimal feature set (not even higher-order functions!) across languages that are widely considered functional. The heuristic for determining which languages are functional might as well be whether the language mentions ‚Äòfunctional‚Äô in its marketing material or shares a family origin with those listed on the sidebar of r/functionalprogramming.

    For the sake of this article, I am willing to tolerate the imprecision of ‚ÄòFearless Tinkering is Functional‚Äô over something that might better match like ‚Äòexpression-oriented‚Äô, ‚Äòdenotative‚Äô, ‚Äòalgebraic‚Äô, or 'structural' (definitional claims are unfalsifiable anyways). I am also willing, when a claim reflects my own opinions, to forgo small nuances (or bury them in footnotes) when speaking to unacquainted audiences. My goals with this specific article are more about connecting valuable ideas through familiar phrasing to a wider audience than advancing a discussion amongst those already equipped with understanding.

    I do think there are more general problems with various commonly-used terms by functional programmers, and that particular statements often lead to poor intuitions and mismatched discussions. I hope to publish more on this topic soon.

    No one needs to learn category theory to become a [great functional programmer](http://comonad.com/reader/2014/letter-to-a-young-haskell-enthusiast/)! Sure, some people have brought great ideas from category theory and other mathematical fields back to the realm of programming. But math gets invented to incorporate great ideas originating from programming (and everywhere else) as well. The [streelight effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streetlight_effect) goes both ways! Programmers should treat math as a tool that serves to give us understanding, rather than a tool we serve to give our understanding.
