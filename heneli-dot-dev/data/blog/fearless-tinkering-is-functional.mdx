# Fearless Tinkering is Functional

<TOCInline toc={props.toc} toHeading={3} asDisclosure />

ü™ù

Sometimes functional programming gets a bad rap. Critics from industry cite a laundry list of issues: lack of commercial validation, high barrier of entry, sparse library catalog, poor documentation, unfamiliar academic culture, frictious tooling, and a dismal entry-level job market. Advocates counter with [a](https://discord.com/blog/how-discord-scaled-elixir-to-5-000-000-concurrent-users) [number](https://mercury.com/) [of](https://www.pagerduty.com/blog/tag/elixir/) [success](https://www.janestreet.com/) [stories](https://hasura.io/) and appeals pointing to [ongoing](https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2022/10/05/my-future-with-elixir-set-theoretic-types/) [improvements](https://haskell.foundation/projects/). ‚Äú[Things](https://zero-to-nix.com/) [_really_](https://zaid-ajaj.github.io/the-elmish-book/#/) [_are_](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server) [getting](https://www.amazon.com/Production-Haskell-Succeeding-Industry/dp/B0BTNVFR2N) [better](https://github.com/haskell/error-messages)!‚Äù Deserved or otherwise, skepticism is hard to overcome.

It‚Äôs certainly never been the case that a functional language was the de facto industry standard like all of Java, Python, and JavaScript have been. By choice[^1] or by fate, the benefits born of iterating a language independent of widespread reliance have been traded against predictable costs on functional ecosystems. When there‚Äôs 10,000 new programmers learning an imperative language to every individual learning a functional one, can a functional approach really compete?[^2]

My answer is yes. While I see merit in the above critiques, I don‚Äôt believe that any of them are inherent. In fact, I‚Äôll argue that the functional paradigm already has best-in-class learnability thanks to **fearless tinkering**.[^4]

## Fearless in Theory

---

### Fear and Complexity

There‚Äôs an endless list of things that invoke fear in programmers. Buggy software, rolling upgrades, concurrency, bit rot, year-out deadlines, service alerts, tech debt, stale builds, nondeterminism, time libraries, ambiguous requirements, hardware faults, software rewrites, network partitions, scope creep, security, and on and on. Each of these can be terrifying on their own. To make matters worse, software rarely has just a single source of horror. Very simple programs written by very thoughtful programmers can host a multitude.

Without the right tools, conquering these fears can feel impossible. If your tools can‚Äôt protect you, you won‚Äôt be able to protect yourself. Some adopt a defensive programming style, but institutionalizing apprehension isn't an end in itself. What use is an infinite roll of duct tape when a ship takes water? If tape can‚Äôt solve the first leak, should one patch the next, pick their battles, or accept fate and lose hope in the voyage? Does a decision even matter when the ship is already sinking? Maybe swimming to shore and joining a new boat would suffice‚Ä¶ at least until that crew wants to tape their leaks. By then, that too will be someone else‚Äôs problem. The cognitive burden of faulty software is real and difficult to remedy. Programming is a social exercise, and teammates won‚Äôt appreciate  a percieved learned helplessness.

Most fears boil down to uncertainty about **complexity**. As Fred Brooks explained in [No Silver Bullet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet), there exists **essential complexity** that cannot be avoided and **accidental complexity** that can.[^5] [Out of the Tar Pit](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/2eb8d21/design/out-of-the-tar-pit.pdf) followed up by diagnosing **state**, **control flow**, and **code volume** as the most frequent culprits underlying accidental complexity. The nature of complexity is festering and exponential, so tackling root causes is always better than addressing symptoms. Put another way, preventing leaks by addressing the inherent structural deficiencies of a ship‚Äôs build is favorable to being skilled at plugging holes.

**Fearless tinkering** is the ability to engage a domain and confidently reason about it while unencumbered by accidental complexity. Whether the domain is concurrency, software upgrades, or something else, a fearless tinkerer can rely on the structural guarantees of their context to safely explore their domain and target the essential complexity of the task at hand. A fearless tinkerer sails a ship where entire classes of leakage are rendered an impossibility. What kinds of leaks are prevented? How are they decided? As discussed in the following sections, these guarantees are determined by the algebra of one‚Äôs program.

### On Functional Programming

Here is a collection of commonly discussed characteristics[^6] from functional languages:[^7]
* Referential Transparency.
* Pure functions.
* Declarative.
* Immutability.
* First-Class Functions.
* Higher-Order Functions.
* Expression-Oriented.
* Pattern Matching.
* Tail Call Elimination.
* Managed Effects.
* Algebraic Datatypes.
* Composability.
* Recursive Datatypes.
* Equational Reasoning.

Functional programming doesn‚Äôt solve complexity, but helps one meet it by surfacing its roots. To do this, functional languages deliver several of the more successful and battle-tested approaches to the state, control flow, and volume.

Functional languages _<u>make stateful complexity explicit</u>_. By pairing immutable defaults with performant and easy-to-use APIs, functional languages minimize the need for mutable state. Introducing mutable state thus becomes an intentional and visible action. Given the elimination of destructive updates, compilers are empowered to reward programmers with greater [expressiveness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fold_%28higher-order_function%29) and [safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_transactional_memory) at less cost. Some functional languages make explicit their ‚Äúeffects‚Äù with types, creating a distinction between ‚Äúeffect-free‚Äù and ‚Äúeffectful‚Äù code to allow separate reasoning.

With a greater reliance on _<u>declarative constructs</u>_ (expressions) over _<u>imperative ones</u>_ (statements), functional languages eliminate a number of control flow complexities. Jump-based statements, which break compositionality and equational reasoning, are replaced with expressions that can be substituted for their ultimate value. Bigger programs can be faithfully decomposed into smaller ones. This allows for the local reasoning of individual parts to hold up when global reasoning is needed about the whole. Thanks to the sole determination of a function‚Äôs outputs on its inputs, purely functional programming creates an experience where ‚Äúwhat you see is what you get‚Äù.

Functional languages address program volume by making mechanical the act of _<u>stripping programs down to their essence</u>_. For instance, verbose wrangling code can be collapsed into neat reusable patterns using higher-order functions and composition. Typed functional languages use parametric, ad-hoc, and other forms of polymorphism to expand ordinary functions over a single domain into general-purpose functions over infinite domains. Typed functional languages also reduce cognitive volume by offloading the rote, mental calculations of dynamism onto programmer‚Äôs better-suited counterparts in computers. As elaborated in the following section, a declarative style relegates implementation details to their relevant semantic layer, making the remaining API naturally terse. Judiscious use of the endless abstraction capabilities helps uncover rock-solid, lean foundations for APIs and wider ecosystems.

Armed with the properties of functional languages, programmers can reclaim their cognitive sovereignty and fearlessly explore software in action.

### Ideas over Implementation Details

> Declare it. Answer how with what. Break the causal chain and unshackle from the past. The world is simply what you say it is. 
> - a sage functional programmer, probably

If language is a tool for thought, then one should value dialects enabling the natural communication of them. Blunted alternatives that intersperse anything meaningful with robotic recitations of language internals or error-prone adaptations to outside alterations are painful to tolerate. A language that yields such fragile mental models debilitates a programmer‚Äôs ability to handle real-world scenarios like context-switching, requirements evolution, and the eventuality of a system‚Äôs growth beyond what can be kept in one‚Äôs head. The essential complexity programmers face is already challenging enough.

When the business calls for an algorithm to determine how many users visited their website last week, no one‚Äôs first thought should have to be about for-loops, heap allocations, b-tree indexes, logic gates, or cosmic rays. No, an API that‚Äôs better suited to immediate communication might yield something like:

```java
all_users -> filter_by(visited_since(-7 days)) -> count()
```

Declarative programming simplifies the act of learning because it 1) meets one at their layer of abstraction and 2) let‚Äôs one focus solely on what‚Äôs in front of them. A well-designed declarative API lays out all the vocabulary and structure one should need, such that formulating solutions through sentences is as natural as placing blocks in a game of Tetris. Learners can focus on encoding the logic of the place they actually care about instead of the windy road they may have taken to get there. By only necessitating a specification of ‚Äòwhat is‚Äô, the programmer is unburdened by the interconnected history of their model‚Äôs state transitions.

### Constraints Liberate

> [Constraints liberate, liberties constrain](https://youtu.be/GqmsQeSzMdw)
> - R√∫nar Bjarnason

Observing the underlying properties of a program is the key to unlocking its simplification. A simple pure function is simple because of the numerous constraints that have already been imposed on it. Also, the restriction of mapping input sets onto output sets eases the discovery of additional mathematical relationships in one‚Äôs program. Employing popular [functional](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/) [techniques](https://kowainik.github.io/posts/haskell-mini-patterns) to prune superfluous code paths can make invariants lurking in our programs even more apparent. By building a toolkit of common operations with associated constraints, one can unlock a useful library of powers to call upon in various programming situations.

One could rightly object that having to learn new mathematical abstractions is trading one kind of complexity for another. In practice, there are but a small handful of core abstractions that frequently occur and are worth their collective weight to the average programmer.[^8] As with the above discussion on declarative programming, one could view learning these abstractions as directly engaging with the fundamentals of their domain. The major benefit of understanding an abstraction is that once you‚Äôve understood it, _you‚Äôve understood it for all of its applications_.

## Fearless in Practice

---

In this section, I‚Äôll introduce two functional technologies and illustrate how their structural properties enable **fearless tinkering**. These alone won‚Äôt do functional ecosystems justice as there are too many examples for exhaustive and in-depth coverage (ex. fearless concurrency in Erlang/Elixir). Even amongst the tools I‚Äôll mention, there are other dimensions of added fearlessness that I won‚Äôt get to. Conversely, I also won't be able to mention existing accidental complexities and structural deficiencies stymieing further fearless flavors.

Much more important than any specific technology are the ideas that underlie them. Demonstrating a market for fearless approaches to the critical pain points of our daily software development will help future iterations and alternatives both incorporate and make accessible the necessary structural guarantees.


### Nix & NixOS

The entropy of modern software is staggering. Programs inside programs directing separate programs exist, and each of them contains their own digital metropolis. Whether it‚Äôs the shear connectors in the bridges, building codes of the plumbing networks, or newest floor plan atop a towering skyscraper, every software artifact reflects a choice made by someone somewhere. The feats of modern software could not be made if every virtual wheel needed reinventing. A global and communal project of shared decisions is harnessed to base, tweak, and publish new constructions.

Despite how foundational accessing external developments is, interfacing with outside software remains a tremendous challenge. Every piece of software has its own installation manual and distribution strategy. Attaining pre-built infrastructure or the materials to create one‚Äôs own means traversing complicated and intersecting digital supply chains. Brittle runbooks, non-reproducible scripts, and imperative packaging tools that freely step on each other‚Äôs work lead to uniquely broken and divergent systems. Fundamental issues like build-time variability, unspecified dependencies, and shared dynamic libraries can turn one-off upgrades into intractable archeological treasure hunts. When stuck in dependency hell, a teammate voicing that some software ‚Äúworks on their machine‚Äù offers more dread than helpfulness.

Nix attempts to solve these problems by introducing a purely functional DevOps ecosystem. By representing all software components in an immutable graph, Nix is able to defang previously panic-inducing deployments and offer rich queries about one‚Äôs system. With a declarative language for describing reproducible system configurations, installing software simply becomes writing a Nix expression to describe a target system with that package installed. The same is true for applying parameter configurations, upgrades, uninstallations, or any deployment action. Developers and operators can focus on what they want their system to look like instead of a sequential migration path to get there. The quality-of-life gains from the structural guarantees Nix provides are highlighted below via ‚Äòfearless environments‚Äô and ‚Äòfearless sharing‚Äô.

#### Fearless Environments

#### Fearless Sharing

### Haskell

Fixing a bug? No problem!

Need a new feature? Sure thing!

Did you read about that best practice? Incorporation was easy!

Handle another edge case? Say less!

Upgrading 50 libraries? üíØ

#### Fearless Refactoring

It is straightforward and mechanical to translate functions into ‚Äúgeneralized‚Äù forms. For example, one progression could be:
* function with several **hardcoded arguments**
* function on **several arguments**
* function on a **record of arguments** (configuration record)
* function on a **record of functions** computing arguments ([handler pattern](https://jaspervdj.be/posts/2018-03-08-handle-pattern.html))
* function dispatched to an ad-hoc **interpreter translating polymorphic operations** into  concrete functions computing arguments (final algebra, [finally tagless](https://serokell.io/blog/introduction-tagless-final))
* function, defined with an eDSL, on an **interpreter translating an AST** into functions computing arguments (initial algebra, [defunctionalization](https://blog.sigplan.org/2019/12/30/defunctionalization-everybody-does-it-nobody-talks-about-it/))
* ‚Ä¶and back again (refunctionalization)

Programmers can pick whatever individual or combination of these equivalent forms best suit their task.

Thanks for reaching the end! Here are some options if you‚Äôd like to get started with functional programming:
* If you‚Äôd like an entry point into application programming with functional languages, I recommend checking out [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) and [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/). 
* If you‚Äôre interested in a functional devops experience, I recommend checking out [Nix](https://nixos.org/) with the [Zero to Nix](https://zero-to-nix.com/) guide.
* If you are looking for a follow-up on incorporating algebraic foundations into your daily work, I recommend reading [Algebra-Driven Design](https://algebradriven.design/).
* If you want to fully immerse yourself in functional programming without familiar imperative crutches, I recommend checking out [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/).[^10]

    You probably noticed that I cowardly deferred to others the task of formally defining ‚Äúfunctional programming‚Äù. The fact of matter is that FP is a vibe.

    More seriously, I use ‚Äúfunctional programming‚Äù as shorthand for a style that avoids mutation and implicit ‚Äúeffects‚Äù. I also define ‚Äúfunctional languages‚Äù as those enabling the representation of programs with expressions that can be substituted for their evaluated value (as is the case for even [‚Äúimpure‚Äù eDSLs like `State` or `IO`](https://twitter.com/lexi_lambda/status/1242878496076189702?s=20)).

    Both the usefulness and accuracy of the term ‚Äúfunctional‚Äù has been debated. Even the meaning and relation of commonly associated descriptors like ‚Äúdeclarative‚Äù is contested. There doesn‚Äôt seem to be a minimal feature set (not even higher-order functions!) across languages that are widely considered functional. The heuristic for determining which languages are functional might as well be whether the language mentions ‚Äòfunctional‚Äô in its marketing material or shares a family origin with those listed on the sidebar of r/functionalprogramming.

    For the sake of this post, I am willing to tolerate the imprecision of ‚ÄòFearless Tinkering is Functional‚Äô over something that might better match like ‚Äòexpression-oriented‚Äô, ‚Äòdenotative‚Äô, ‚Äòalgebraic‚Äô, or 'structural' (definitional claims are unfalsifiable anyways). I am also willing, when a claim reflects my own opinions, to forgo small nuances (or bury them in footnotes) when speaking to unacquainted audiences. My goals with this specific post are more about connecting valuable ideas through familiar phrasing to a wider audience than advancing a discussion for those already equipped with understanding. 

    I do think there are more general problems with various commonly-used terms by functional programmers, and that particular statements often lead to poor intuitions and mismatched discussions. I hope to publish more on this topic soon.

    [14] For video learners, Philipp Hagenlocher's [Haskell for Imperative Programmers](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLe7Ei6viL6jGp1Rfu0dil1JH1SHk9bgDV) playlist is a phenomenal introductory exposure. If, like me, you like 1000+ page tutorials with ample hand-holding, you could learn with [Haskell from First Principles](https://haskellbook.com/). Otherwise, the upcoming [Effective Haskell](https://pragprog.com/titles/rshaskell/effective-haskell/) book seems, from my brief skim, like a promising early resource. Additionally, helpful online references like [Typeclasses](https://typeclasses.com/) and [Kowainik‚Äôs blog](https://kowainik.github.io/posts) can be very beginner-friendly. The (formerly NICTA) [fp-course](https://github.com/system-f/fp-course) is a guided exercise that‚Äôs perfect for beginners struggling to grapple with fundamental abstractions.

    For those desiring intermediate resources, I can strongly recommend [Production Haskell](https://www.amazon.com/Production-Haskell-Succeeding-Industry/dp/B0BTNVFR2N), [Thinking with Types](https://thinkingwithtypes.com/), and the _Concurrent_ section of the classic [Parallel and Concurrent Programming in Haskell](https://www.amazon.com/Parallel-Concurrent-Programming-Haskell-Multithreaded/dp/1449335942). Additionally, promising works on the horizon like [The Haskell Optimization Handbook](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hs-opt-handbook.github.io) and some unannounced efforts make now a great time to get in.
