Sometimes functional programming gets a bad rap. Critics from industry cite a laundry list of issues including lack of commercial validation, high barrier of entry, sparse library catalog, poor documentation, unfamiliar academic culture, frictious tooling, and a dismal entry-level job market. Advocates counter with [a](https://discord.com/blog/how-discord-scaled-elixir-to-5-000-000-concurrent-users) [number](https://mercury.com/) [of](https://www.pagerduty.com/blog/tag/elixir/) [success](https://www.janestreet.com/) [stories](https://hasura.io/) and appeals pointing to [ongoing](https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2022/10/05/my-future-with-elixir-set-theoretic-types/) [improvements](https://haskell.foundation/projects/). ‚Äú[Things](https://zero-to-nix.com/) [_really_](https://zaid-ajaj.github.io/the-elmish-book/#/) [_are_](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server) [getting](https://www.amazon.com/Production-Haskell-Succeeding-Industry/dp/B0BTNVFR2N) [better](https://github.com/haskell/error-messages)!‚Äù Deserved or otherwise, skepticism is hard to overcome.

It‚Äôs certainly never been the case that a functional language was the de facto industry standard like all of Java, Python, and JavaScript have been. By choice[^1] or by fate, the benefits born of iterating a language independent of widespread reliance have been traded against predictable costs on functional ecosystems. When there‚Äôs 10,000 new programmers learning an imperative language to every individual learning a functional one, can a functional approach really compete?[^2]

My answer is yes. While I see merit in the above critiques, I don‚Äôt believe that any of them are inherent. In fact, I‚Äôll argue that the functional paradigm already has best-in-class learnability thanks to **fearless tinkering**.[^4]

## Fearless in Theory

---

### Fear and Complexity

There‚Äôs an endless list of things that invoke fear in programmers:
|  |  |  |   |
| - | :- | -: | :-: |
| Buggy software | rolling upgrades | concurrency | bit rot |
| year-out deadlines | service alerts | tech debt | stale builds |
| nondeterminism | time libraries | ambiguous requirements | hardware faults |
| software rewrites | network partitions | scope creep | security |

...and on and on. Each of these can be terrifying on their own. To make matters worse, software rarely has just a single source of horror. Very simple programs written by very thoughtful programmers can host a multitude.

Without the right tools, conquering these fears can feel impossible. If your tools can‚Äôt protect you, you won‚Äôt be able to protect yourself. Some adopt a defensive programming style, but institutionalizing apprehension isn't an end in itself. What use is an infinite roll of duct tape when a ship takes water? If tape can‚Äôt solve the first leak, should one patch the next, pick their battles, or accept fate and lose hope in the voyage? Does a decision even matter when the ship is already sinking? Maybe swimming to shore and joining a new boat would suffice‚Ä¶ at least until that crew wants to tape their leaks. By then, that too will be someone else‚Äôs problem. The cognitive burden of faulty software is real and difficult to remedy. Programming is a social exercise, and teams will burn out accomodating learned helplessness.

Most fears boil down to uncertainty about **complexity**. As Fred Brooks explained in [No Silver Bullet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet), there exists **essential complexity** that cannot be avoided and **accidental complexity** that can.[^5] [Out of the Tar Pit](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/2eb8d21/design/out-of-the-tar-pit.pdf) followed up by diagnosing **state**, **control flow**, and **code volume** as the most frequent culprits underlying accidental complexity. The nature of complexity is festering and exponential, so tackling root causes is always better than addressing symptoms. Put another way, preventing leaks by addressing the inherent structural deficiencies of a ship‚Äôs build is favorable to being skilled at plugging holes.

**Fearless tinkering** is the ability to engage a domain and confidently reason about it while unencumbered by accidental complexity. Whether the domain is concurrency, software upgrades, or something else, a fearless tinkerer can rely on the structural guarantees of their context to safely explore their domain and target the essential complexity of the task at hand. A fearless tinkerer sails a ship where entire classes of leakage are rendered an impossibility. What kinds of leaks are prevented? How are they decided? As discussed in the following sections, these guarantees are determined by the algebra of one‚Äôs program.

### On Functional Programming

The functional style encourages transformation-based workflows over state-based workflows. To motivate this approach, functional languages commonly offer a collection[^6] of characteristics:[^7]
|  |  |  |   |
| - | :- | -: | :-: |
| Referential Transparency | Pure functions | Declarative | Immutability |
| First-Class Functions | Higher-Order Functions | Expression-Oriented | Pattern Matching |
| Tail Call Elimination | Managed Effects | Algebraic Datatypes | Compositionality |
| Recursive Datatypes | Equational Reasoning | | |

Functional programming doesn‚Äôt solve complexity, but helps one meet it by surfacing its roots. To do this, functional languages deliver several of the more successful and battle-tested approaches to the state, control flow, and volume.

Functional languages _<u>make stateful complexity explicit</u>_. By pairing immutable defaults with performant and easy-to-use APIs, functional languages minimize the need for mutable state. Introducing mutable state thus becomes an intentional and visible action. Given the elimination of destructive updates, compilers are empowered to reward programmers with greater [expressiveness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fold_%28higher-order_function%29) and [safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_transactional_memory) at less cost. Some functional languages make explicit their ‚Äúeffects‚Äù with types, creating a distinction that allows separate reasoning of ‚Äúeffect-free‚Äù and ‚Äúeffectful‚Äù code.

With a greater reliance on _<u>declarative constructs</u>_ (expressions) over _<u>imperative ones</u>_ (statements), functional languages eliminate a number of control flow complexities. Jump-based statements, which break compositionality and equational reasoning, are replaced with expressions that can be substituted for their evaluations. Bigger programs can be faithfully decomposed into smaller ones. This allows for the local reasoning of individual parts to hold up when global reasoning is needed about the whole. Thanks to the sole determination of a function‚Äôs outputs on its inputs, purely functional programming creates an experience where ‚Äúwhat you see is what you get‚Äù.

Functional languages address program volume by making mechanical the act of _<u>stripping programs down to their essence</u>_. For instance, verbose wrangling code can be collapsed into neat reusable patterns using higher-order functions and composition. Typed functional languages use various polymorphisms to replace infinitely-many functions over one domain with an economy of functions over infinite domains. Typed functional languages also reduce cognitive volume by offloading the rote calculations of dynamism onto programmer‚Äôs better-suited counterparts in computers. As elaborated in the following section, relegating implementation details to the relevant semantic layer makes declarative APIs naturally terse. Judiscious use of abstraction capabilities assists in uncovering rock-solid, lean foundations for APIs and wider ecosystems.

Armed with the properties of functional languages, programmers can reclaim their cognitive sovereignty and fearlessly explore software in action.

### Ideas over Implementation Details

If language is a tool for thought, then one should value dialects enabling the natural communication of them. Blunted alternatives that intersperse anything meaningful with robotic recitations of language internals or error-prone adaptations to outside alterations are frustrating to tolerate. A language that yields such fragile mental models debilitates a programmer‚Äôs ability to handle real-world scenarios like context-switching, requirements evolution, and the eventuality of a system‚Äôs growth beyond what can be kept in one‚Äôs head. The essential complexity programmers face is already challenging enough.

When the business calls for an algorithm to determine how many users visited their website last week, no one‚Äôs first thought should have to be about for-loops, heap allocations, b-tree indexes, logic gates, or cosmic rays. No, an API that‚Äôs better suited to immediate communication might yield something like:

```java
all_users -> filter_by(visited_since(-7 days)) -> count()
```

Declarative programming simplifies the act of learning because it 1) meets one at their layer of abstraction and 2) let‚Äôs one focus solely on what‚Äôs in front of them. A well-designed declarative API lays out all the vocabulary and structure one should need, such that formulating solutions through sentences is as natural as placing blocks in a game of Tetris. Learners can focus on encoding the logic of the place they actually care about instead of the windy road they may have taken to get there. By only necessitating specification of a goal state, the programmer are unburdened by the interconnected history of their model's state transitions.

### Constraints Liberate

> Freedom at one level leads to restriction at another. A constraint at one level leads to freedom and power at another level.
>
> - R√∫nar Bjarnason, [Constraints liberate, Liberties constrain](https://youtu.be/GqmsQeSzMdw)

Observing the underlying properties of a program is the key to unlocking its simplification. Pure functions are simple because of the numerous constraints imposed on them. The restriction of mapping input sets onto output sets eases the discovery of additional relationships in one‚Äôs program. Employing popular [functional](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/) [techniques](https://kowainik.github.io/posts/haskell-mini-patterns) to prune superfluous code paths can make further invariants lurking in our programs even more apparent. By building an arsenal of common operations with associated constraints, one can unlock a useful toolkit of powers to call upon in various programming situations.

One could rightly object that having to learn new mathematical abstractions is trading one kind of complexity for another. In practice, there are but a small handful of core abstractions that programmers will typically run into and are thus worth their collective weight.[^8] Learning frequently occuring abstractions could be viewed as deepening one's understanding of their domain. The major benefit of learning said abstractions is that once you‚Äôve understood them, you‚Äôve understood them for all of their applications.

## Fearless in Practice

> Beyond the right tool for the job, it is the right values for the job‚Ä¶ and then the right software for the values.

Programmers make mistakes. As such, our tools should aspire not to punish us for unfamiliarity or occasional incorrectness. Too often users stumble into a tool's legitimate accidental complexity, only to be chided for ‚Äúholding it wrong‚Äù as if they should feel guilty for letting the tool paint them into a corner. Of course, tools that overreact to surface considerations can be just a problematic. No one wants an overzealous tool that ‚Äúhelpfully‚Äù enacts what hasn‚Äôt been asked for. Instead, tools should focus on preventing unrecoverable choices from being made too casually or too late. When a situation calls for an action with serious implications, our tools should help us feel the weight of our request. Uniformly weighting every possibility will lead users to falsely assume that either every action is reasonable or every action is fallible. Tools shouldn‚Äôt be afraid to immediately report suspected incorrectness. Discovering mistakes during the construction of a new home is much less painful than making the same discoveries after a family has moved into it.

Approaches that meet individual critiques with individual solutions are prone to local maxima. Breakthroughs often require recognition of the systemic complexities underpinning individual occurrences. Ideal tools are dedicated to proactively sussing out fundamental weakness, rather than reactively catering to symptoms.[^9] Hence, selecting tools by their <u>**structural guarantees**</u> is about <u>using one's **values** to elect the ways their software _can‚Äôt_ go wrong</u>. A fearless tinkerer knows they can be wrong, strong!

In this section, I‚Äôll introduce two functional technologies and illustrate how their structural properties enable **fearless tinkering**. These alone won‚Äôt do functional ecosystems justice.[^10] Even amongst the tools mentioned, there are plenty of assurances I won't cover. Conversely, I won't spend much time on their structural deficiencies and vestigial footguns[^11].

Much more important than any specific technology are the ideas that underlie them. Calling out the need for fearless approaches to the critical pain points of our daily work will help future technologies make the relevant structural guarantees accessible.


### Nix & NixOS

The entropy of modern software is staggering. Programs inside programs directing separate programs exist with each layer containing their own digital metropolis. Whether it‚Äôs the shear connectors in the bridges, building codes of the plumbing networks, or newest floor plan atop a towering skyscraper, every software artifact reflects a choice made by someone somewhere. The feats of modern software could not be made if every virtual wheel needed reinventing. A global and communal project of shared decisions is harnessed to base, tweak, and publish new constructions.

Despite how foundational accessing external developments is, interfacing with outside software remains a tremendous challenge. Every piece of software has its own installation manual and distribution strategy. Attaining pre-built infrastructure or the materials to create one‚Äôs own means traversing complicated and intersecting digital supply chains. Brittle runbooks, non-reproducible scripts, and imperative packaging tools that freely step on each other‚Äôs work lead to uniquely broken and divergent systems. Fundamental issues like build-time variability, unspecified dependencies, and implicit mutation of shared libraries can turn one-off upgrades into intractable archeological treasure hunts. When stuck in dependency hell, a teammate voicing that some software ‚Äúworks on their machine‚Äù offers more dread than helpfulness.

Nix attempts to solve these problems by introducing a purely functional DevOps ecosystem. By representing all software components in an immutable graph, Nix is able to offer rich queries about one‚Äôs system and defang panic-inducing deployments. With a declarative language for reproducible system configurations, installing software simply becomes writing a Nix expression that describes a target system with that package installed. The same is true for applying parameter configurations, upgrades, uninstallations, dependency modifications, or any deployment action. Instead of divining sequential migration paths, developers and operators can focus solely on what they want their system to look like. The limitations of traditional infrastructure is contrasted below with Nix.

#### Traditional Infrastructure: Advances and Limitations

> The <u>world</u> is all that is the case. A <u>computation</u> is any action taken by a programmable device. An <u>environment</u> is the set of all past and present worlds that a computation can observe. An <u>effect</u> is a computation that depends on or changes the program‚Äôs environment. We run programs to produce effects in the world around us.
>
> - Patrick Thomson, definitions from ["Building Haskell Programs with Fused Effects"](https://youtu.be/vfDazZfxlNs?t=145)

For many developers, infrastructure is an uncomfortable area. Whether it‚Äôs the state of a cluster on `us-east-2` or a configuration outside one‚Äôs project repository, reasoning about [action at a distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_at_a_distance_%28computer_programming%29) can be treacherous. Further, the stakes are often high when managing software deployments. A tangled web of mutual, implicit dependencies means that modifying one‚Äôs system could lead to getting stuck in an invalid state. Tolerating a ‚Äúworking‚Äù yet unsatisfactory environment is frequently preferable to the risks of transitioning to something better. As experimentation with alternatives is difficult, iterating is normally restricted to when one‚Äôs hand is forced or the alternative has already been intimately understood. Even the modern practice of automated upgrades for existing dependencies is [fraught](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.11921v1). Tools for managing remote environments tend to remain unfamiliar as the consequences of trying them out might yield an expensive `$CLOUD_PROVIDER` bill.

A horrible culmination of these frictions is regularly found in operational firefighting. Operators are tasked with debugging a live system whose interface, tools, and symptoms are typically only practiced against when problems occur. Even in organizations with significant platform investments, the exploratory surface of test deployments rarely reflects the time and space pollution built up across all contributing local developer and remote production environments.

Application programming, in contrast, can give developers a sense of power and ease. Assuming a stable working environment, the behavior and outputs of a local program are far more observable. Equipped with a test harness, REPL, and breakpointing facilities, an interactive view of one‚Äôs program, including local bindings and available operations, can be explored. An application programmer can wield static analyzers, linters, IDE feedback, and all their most familiar tools to iteratively coax their programs into the desired shape. The ultimate execution of their developments in production can be separated behind various stages of evaluation like continuous integration, peer review, staging deployments, and quality assurance.

While it might mean tremendous pain in the short term, application programmers can usually throw their hands up and start over from scratch when an insurmountable problem arises in their local environment. If a developer ties their local project repository into an knot, they can blow it away and pull down a fresh copy. Application programmers regularly break their own local environments in ways that would be intolerable anywhere else. Though program behaviors are inseparable from their execution environments, application programmers can approximate control over their state space by optimizing for their own fixed environment.

Containers and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) are popular answers to the question of whether infrastructure can achieve the same advantages as application programming.

...

Not all is rosy. The imperative nature of things like Dockerfiles destroys compositionality and reproduciblity.

#### Fearless Environments

Nix Store is an append-only graph database that stores components in a file system.

Let's say I wanted to know the dependencies of the `python` package I installed on my Mac [using Nix](https://github.com/hkailahi/dotnix/blob/c59b2e2654f8a84cab1ac59ab72e991ffe84ca70/home.nix#L20). First, I can confirm that the package is installed and present in my local Nix database (called the [Nix Store](https://zero-to-nix.com/concepts/nix-store)):
```bash
$ readlink $(which python)
/nix/store/b07jgllrc7lxa1k91ycrwd6b6103rnr3-python3-3.11.2/bin/python
```

One option would be to inspect the package's build plan (called a [derivation](https://zero-to-nix.com/concepts/derivations)) to find direct dependencies and their build plans:
```bash
$ nix show-derivation $(which python) | jq '.[].inputDrvs | keys'
[
  "/nix/store/1xahjpviam9852a7scsia0q2bjb094qp-expat-2.5.0.drv",
  "/nix/store/27937yxcz188rjjlccsflkf9c13l4d4f-libxcrypt-4.4.33.drv",
  "/nix/store/348m2mrwr5fzf342mj6syi2kcndjizc7-bzip2-1.0.8.drv",
  "/nix/store/6a1h1vmygpn6ndw82rccp8py2vk1hwgk-mailcap-2.1.53.drv",
  "/nix/store/98vrd1paa9nnnw9sgv9s02fcfylcgkph-tzdata-2022g.drv",
  "/nix/store/c6v0sdff24f3v927gghavbccikqvigbg-openssl-3.0.8.drv",
  "/nix/store/cry7j70x7g18iyk4zbkl438xgpgf391v-libffi-3.4.4.drv",
  "/nix/store/dckqzhb1jvsa58kja64hxwalayf2nisy-Python-3.11.2.tar.xz.drv",
  "/nix/store/f5l3izi0531c2v7ghrpr1y19zfn38dpj-sqlite-3.41.0.drv",
  "/nix/store/hxfa8y04mirqks2jq85cjal3hqqkg56h-nuke-references.drv",
  "/nix/store/i3pdq0fxgddnfhvcixky40by5rd9x743-gdbm-1.23.drv",
  "/nix/store/i5hjpgcds94pbvykhhn37v187i721j4z-readline-8.2p1.drv",
  "/nix/store/p0635v6skcncxhby1vlmbwhz3623g2jp-ncurses-6.4.drv",
  "/nix/store/q6ia1g3g9q1wcn54z51dfk6wkiivb8z2-stdenv-darwin.drv",
  "/nix/store/r569q0lh69dgdhgayvzi3lh57b30k1q4-xz-5.4.1.drv",
  "/nix/store/r72rgwi54aybpd7srj34smbs075vzww5-bash-5.2-p15.drv",
  "/nix/store/rj0zk4938sm9gfs4xk2rgdwwnk8hi368-configd-453.19.drv",
  "/nix/store/wb2b6ckrdrhgq5bxnxyhvkxyaa3b01g8-python-setup-hook.sh.drv",
  "/nix/store/wvs3d46lz7ji4lijhdzwkf1clrd1xaxz-zlib-1.2.13.drv"
]
```

Then, I could build off this to recursively inspect ancestral build plans. Instead, I'll use Nix's CLI to both query the Nix Store for dependency graph and temporarily install the `graphviz` package to visualize it:
```bash
$ nix-store --query $(which python) --graph | nix-shell -p graphviz --command 'dot -Tpng > python_deps.png'
```
![Python Dependency Graph](/static/images/blog/python_deps.png)

Nix is input-addressable by default.

Separation of evaluation and execution. Instantiate populates your Nix Store

Nix is versatile and expandable. It can fit neatly within existing infrastructure with rich ways of defining atoms like containers. It can also entirely subsume previous infrastructure with things like NixOS, NixOps, and deploy-rs.

It is straightforward and mechanical to translate functions into ‚Äúgeneralized‚Äù forms. For example, one progression could be:

- function with several **hardcoded arguments**
- function on **several arguments**
- function on a **record of arguments** (configuration record)

Thanks for reaching the end! Here are some options if you‚Äôd like to get started with functional programming:

- If you‚Äôd like an entry point into application programming with functional languages, I recommend checking out [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) and [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/).
- If you‚Äôre interested in a functional devops experience, I recommend checking out [Nix](https://nixos.org/).[^12]
- If you are looking for a follow-up on incorporating algebraic foundations into your daily work, I recommend reading [Algebra-Driven Design](https://algebradriven.design/).
- If you want to fully immerse yourself in functional programming without familiar imperative crutches, I recommend checking out [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/).[^13]

    Source: I made it up. The best I could find was the [2022 Stack Overflow Developer Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#technology) and the [March 2023 TIOBE index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/), which can‚Äôt directly validate my claim but weakly support it‚Äôs order of magnitude.

    Per Stack Overflow, Scala (2.59%), Haskell (2.22%), Elixir (2.15%), Clojure (1.51%), F# (1.03%), Erlang (0.9%), and OCaml (0.59%) make up a combined 10.4% of 71,547 responses for [Most Popular Technologies](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#technology-most-popular-technologies) survey, none of which meet the 5000 connection minimum in the 69,362 respondent [Work With vs Want to Work With](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#worked-with-vs-want-to-work-with-language-worked-want) survey.

    Per TIOBE popularity index, only #25 F# (0.53%), #31 Haskell (0.34%), and #38 Scala (0.23%) make the top 50, with all of Elixir, Erlang, Common Lisp, Schema, Clojure, F#, Erlang, and OCaml landing between top 51 - 100.

    I suspect that many of my peers will find this claim absurd. It's important to acknowledge that countless have bounced off of functional languages and that serious efforts by functional advocates have been spent because of these approachability issues.

    When I say the functional paradigm has best-in-class *learnability*, my focus is on the inherent qualities of functional languages. One could substitute my use of *learnability* for *understandability*, and that would be a fair starting point. However, that wouldn‚Äôt capture my view that learnability is directly correlated to how far one can explore without consequence. The functional style achieves this freedom by explicating assumptions and building everything upon expressions. This burdenless discoverability is why I believe the functional paradigm is more learnable (and continually so) for beginner, intermediate, and advanced practitioners. Functional shops should be doing a better job of wielding this market advantage, and yet, bafflingly, many have found ways to turn this strength into a weakness.

    Of course, learning a language in practice has as much to do with the language itself as with its peripherals. Pedagogy, tooling, industrial opportunities, marketing, and community are all essential for initial exposure to ideas and a holistic learning experience. While the peripherals around a paradigm or language can change, the fundamentals are more sticky. The software industry has shown a greater appetite for adopting new variations on technologies than  new language foundations, but cross-pollination and the need to overcome accidental complexity have led to the popularization of many functional ideas.

    This all isn‚Äôt to say that functional programming is the ultimate destination. Comparisons to mainstream paradigms is a limited experiment as none of the existing incarnations are particularly ‚Äúlearnable‚Äù. While the functional paradigm can offer greater safeguards than imperative alternatives, neither has yielded a satisfactory and industrial-grade experience embodying other qualities of a [learnable experience](https://web.archive.org/web/20201105061430/http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/) (ex. interactivity, visualization, uniformity, immediacy, etc). It‚Äôs possible that achieving this will require new paradigms built on top of functional foundations. More on that in the future‚Ä¶

[^5]: The definition of accidental complexity in 'Out of the Tar Pit' is more specific to requirements of the user, but. in this post, can be treated more broadly as meaning self-inflicted or avoidable complexity.

    You may have noticed that I cowardly deferred to others the task of formally defining ‚Äúfunctional programming‚Äù. The fact of matter is that FP is a vibe.

    More seriously, I use ‚Äúfunctional programming‚Äù as shorthand for a style that avoids mutation and implicit ‚Äúeffects‚Äù. I also define ‚Äúfunctional languages‚Äù as those enabling the representation of programs with expressions that can be substituted for their evaluated value (as is the case for even [‚Äúimpure‚Äù eDSLs like `State` or `IO`](https://twitter.com/lexi_lambda/status/1242878496076189702?s=20)).

    Both the usefulness and accuracy of the term ‚Äúfunctional‚Äù has been debated. Even the meaning and relation of commonly associated descriptors like ‚Äúdeclarative‚Äù is contested. There doesn‚Äôt seem to be a minimal feature set (not even higher-order functions!) across languages that are widely considered functional. The heuristic for determining which languages are functional might as well be whether the language mentions ‚Äòfunctional‚Äô in its marketing material or shares a family origin with those listed on the sidebar of r/functionalprogramming.

    For the sake of this post, I am willing to tolerate the imprecision of ‚ÄòFearless Tinkering is Functional‚Äô over something that might better match like ‚Äòexpression-oriented‚Äô, ‚Äòdenotative‚Äô, ‚Äòalgebraic‚Äô, or 'structural' (definitional claims are unfalsifiable anyways). I am also willing, when a claim reflects my own opinions, to forgo small nuances (or bury them in footnotes) when speaking to unacquainted audiences. My goals with this specific post are more about connecting valuable ideas through familiar phrasing to a wider audience than advancing a discussion for those already equipped with understanding.

    I do think there are more general problems with various commonly-used terms by functional programmers, and that particular statements often lead to poor intuitions and mismatched discussions. I hope to publish more on this topic soon.

[^8]: No one needs to learn category theory to become a [great functional programmer](http://comonad.com/reader/2014/letter-to-a-young-haskell-enthusiast/)! Sure, some people have brought great ideas from category theory and other mathematical fields back to the realm of programming. But math gets invented to incorporate great ideas originating from programming (and everywhere else) as well. The [streelight effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streetlight_effect) goes both ways! Programmers should treat math as a tool that serves to give us understanding, rather than a tool we serve to give our understanding.

    For video learners, Brian McKenna's [RootConf 2019 talk](https://youtu.be/RtqWE5lgaCg) and Burke Libbey's [Nix: What Even is it Though](https://youtu.be/6iVXaqUfHi4) are accessible overviews of Nix and it's ideas.

    To get started using Nix, I recommend following the [Zero to Nix](https://zero-to-nix.com/) Quick Start guide. From there, I recommend checking out nix.dev, Official NixOS learning page, and/or the follow-up resources recommended at the end of the [Zero to Nix](https://zero-to-nix.com/start/learn-more) Quick Start guide.

    Some blogposts that I've particularly enjoyed include:

    - [Erase your darlings](https://grahamc.com/blog/erase-your-darlings/)
    - [Paranoid NixOS Setup](https://xeiaso.net/blog/paranoid-nixos-2021-07-18) and [Paranoid NixOS on AWS](https://xeiaso.net/blog/paranoid-nixos-aws-2021-08-11)
    - [Tidying up your $HOME with Nix](https://juliu.is/tidying-your-home-with-nix/)
    - [Declarative management of dotfiles with Nix and Home Manager](https://www.bekk.christmas/post/2021/16/dotfiles-with-nix-and-home-manager)
    - [Managing Firefox on macOS with Nix](https://cmacr.ae/post/2020-05-09-managing-firefox-on-macos-with-nix/)

    For intermediate audiences, check out the upcoming [NixOS in Production](https://leanpub.com/nixos-in-production) book.

    For video learners, Philipp Hagenlocher's [Haskell for Imperative Programmers](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLe7Ei6viL6jGp1Rfu0dil1JH1SHk9bgDV) playlist is a phenomenal introductory exposure. If, like me, you like 1000+ page tutorials with ample hand-holding, you could learn with [Haskell from First Principles](https://haskellbook.com/). Otherwise, the upcoming [Effective Haskell](https://pragprog.com/titles/rshaskell/effective-haskell/) book seems, from my brief skim, like a promising early resource. Additionally, helpful online references like [Typeclasses](https://typeclasses.com/) and [Kowainik‚Äôs blog](https://kowainik.github.io/posts) can be very beginner-friendly. [fp-course](https://github.com/system-f/fp-course) and Brian McKenna's [video walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLly9WMAVMrayYo2c-1E_rIRwBXG_FbLBW) is a great hands-on exercise that‚Äôs perfect for beginners struggling to grapple with fundamental abstractions. Finally, [What I Wish I Knew When Learning Haskell](https://github.com/sdiehl/wiwinwlh) can serve as a solid, free reference for checking your understanding of various topics.

    For intermediate audiences, I can strongly recommend [Production Haskell](https://www.amazon.com/Production-Haskell-Succeeding-Industry/dp/B0BTNVFR2N), [Thinking with Types](https://thinkingwithtypes.com/), and the _Concurrent_ section of the classic [Parallel and Concurrent Programming in Haskell](https://www.amazon.com/Parallel-Concurrent-Programming-Haskell-Multithreaded/dp/1449335942). Additionally, promising works on the horizon like [The Haskell Optimization Handbook](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hs-opt-handbook.github.io) and some unannounced efforts make now a great time to get in.
